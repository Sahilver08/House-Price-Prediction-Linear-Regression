# House-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression

This project implements both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models to predict house prices based on various features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. The dataset is preprocessed using one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and model performance is evaluated using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² metrics. A bar chart of feature coefficients helps interpret which factors most influence house prices. This project demonstrates a fundamental application of regression in machine learning using Python and scikit-learn.
